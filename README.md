# nws_api_testing

#currently all we have here is a test of the NWS coordinates -> gridpoints forecast endpoint
#looks like about 12-15% of the time the NWS points a lat/lon coordinate to a grid about 1-2 miles from the coordinate
#not sure why this is but here you can test it on a list of the top 1000 us cities by population
